# Hi, I'm Nizar! 👋

## My Mission 🚀

- **💥 I want to change the way people edit videos. 💥**
	- Like musicians and producers share their favorite VSTs, video editors should have a toolbox of scripts, that they love to use and share.
  - Video editors should profit of custom scripting culture! 🎉

- **💥 I want to uncover awesome linguistic findings in small languages. 💥**
	- Incredible knowledge is hidden beyond the linguistics of the few common languages most research is focused on.
  - I want to unearth this neglected information using computational methods! 🎉
